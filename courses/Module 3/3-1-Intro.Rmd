</p>

-	Definition - define the problem well to create mathematical objective
-	Data - collection process, completeness,  
-	Exploration - data integrity, univariate and multivariate analysis
-	Modeling - map the business problem to an appropriate statistical technique
-	Action - bring model and results into action

## Definition 

The marketing team of a financial services company has approached us for helping them understand their customers. They would like us to find the characteristics of ethereum holders that differentiate them from non holders. 

They were able to collect responses from some loyal customers, and would like to be able to predict whether a customer owns ethereum so that they can offer reward points in crypto or fiat accordingly.

In this module, our objectives are to -  

- Find distinguishing characteristics of ethereum owners: We will find this using statistical analysis and unsupervised machine learning techniques. 
- Predict whether a new individual is an ethereum owner or not: We will find this using a number of supervised learning techniques.

---

## Tidyverse metapackage

We will use the tidyverse set of packages for data reading, manipulations and visualizations.  https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/

The following packages will be used in this analysis:

- readr: for data reading
- dplyr: for creating, modifying, deleting, grouping and summarising data
- ggplot2: for data visualisation

Let us first install it by running 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

---

## Data

Our dataset is a survey response dataset containing certain demographic details of adults and whether or not they own ethereum.

Let's 

- load **tidyverse** library for data analysis. 
- read in data and look at the dimensions of the data

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
data_raw <- read_csv("data/data_raw.csv")

dim(data_raw)
```

There are `r nrow(data_raw)` observations, or adults, and `r ncol(data_raw)` characteristics collected for each adult

---

Looking at the first few rows

```{r}
head(data_raw)
```

Notice that the columns containing text is shown as `<chr>` (character). We will convert them to factor variable.

---

### Assigning data types

The columns which have categorical data are not represented well by the 'character' data type. In R we use the 'factor' data structure to represent these columns correctly.  

```{r}
data <- data_raw %>%
    mutate(across(where(is.character), as_factor))
```

Let's now look at the summary statistics

```{r, eval=FALSE, out.height=3}
summary(data)
```

---

<pre style="font-size:11pt">
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold'}
summary(data)
```
</pre>


Notice max values of '99999' in *capital_gain* and  '99' in *hours_per_week* 

---

```{r}
hist(data$hours_per_week)
```

---

### Data Integrity

When we look at the summary statistics for *capital_gain* and *hours_per_week*, we notice max values look suspicious. We can see this clearly using a boxplot.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(y = capital_gain)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

### Missing Values

On cross checking this with the appropriate data collection team they tell us that 99999 in capital_gain and 99 in hours_per_week were encoded to denote missing values.

Let's correct this discrepancy in the data.

```{r}
data <- data %>%
    mutate(capital_gain = ifelse(capital_gain == 99999, NA, capital_gain)) %>%
    mutate(hours_per_week = ifelse(hours_per_week == 99, NA, hours_per_week)) 
```
---

## Summary using skimr

`skimr` is a useful package to view summary statistics, distributions and missing values

```{r, eval=FALSE, fig.keep='none'}
library(skimr)
data %>%
    skim()
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height=1}
data %>%
    skimr::skim()
```

---

## Exploration

After the initial summary statistics and integrity checks on the columns, we can look at individual characteristics and see how they vary between the ethereum owner vs non owner groups.

### Univariate analysis

What is the proportion of owners vs non owners?

```{r}
data %>%
    group_by(owns_ethereum) %>%
    summarise(n = n(), nperc = n/nrow(data)*100)
```
---

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = owns_ethereum)) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

Distribution of Age

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

---

What is the percentage of Males vs Females in the data?

```{r}
data %>%
 group_by(sex) %>%
 summarise(n = n(), nperc = n/nrow(data)*100)
```

---

## Exploration - Multivariate Analysis

Correlations

```{r}
cor(data %>% select(where(is.numeric), donated, owns_ethereum) ,
    use = "complete.obs")

```

From the numeric variables - Age, Education and Donations are correlated to *owns_ethereum*

---

We can add in the owns_ethereum variable to understand distributional differences. 

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = age, fill = owns_ethereum)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5)

```

Ethereum owners seem to be younger. Try using `geom_density()` to make a neater plot!

---

What is the percentage of men who are ethereum owners?

```{r}
data %>%
  filter(sex == "Male") %>%
  group_by(owns_ethereum) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), nperc = n/nrow(.)*100)
```
What about women?

```{r}
data %>%
  filter(sex == "Female") %>%
  group_by(owns_ethereum) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), nperc = n/nrow(.)*100)
```

---

Answering this visually

```{r}
ggplot(data = data) +
  aes(x = sex, fill = owns_ethereum) +
  geom_bar()
```

is the plot useful to answer the question?

---

## Visualizing Proportions

When visualizing categorical variables, it is useful to look at proportions. Especially if there are more observations in one level compared to the other levels, like this case where there are more Males.

```{r}
ggplot(data = data) +
  aes(x = sex, fill = owns_ethereum) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

---

## Your Turn

Find what percentage of ethereum owners are also donors?

---

## Answer

```{r}
data %>%
    filter(owns_ethereum == "TRUE") %>%
    group_by(donated) %>%
    summarise(n = n(), nperc = n/nrow(.)*100)

```
---

```{r}
ggplot(data = data) +
  aes(x = donated, fill = owns_ethereum) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```


---

## Mean

We can also find the average of each characteristic for ethereum owners vs non owners. Since the mean only works for numeric data types, we first `select` all the numeric columns in the data, and then use the familiar `group` and `summarise` command.

```{r, fig.height=8}
data %>%
    select(owns_ethereum, where(is.numeric)) %>%
    group_by(owns_ethereum) %>%
    summarise_all(funs(mean(., na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
    data.frame()

```

---

## Your Turn - Mode

- Find the mode or the most frequently occurring characteristics of the ethereum holders and the non holders. 

  You can use the helper function 'get_mode()' given below 

```{r}

get_mode <- function(v) {
    all_levels <- unique(v)
    all_levels[which.max(tabulate(match(v, all_levels)))]
}

```

- How do the majority characteristics vary between the two groups?

---

## Answer

```{r, fig.height=8}
data %>%
    group_by(owns_ethereum) %>%
    summarise_all(funs(get_mode(.))) %>%
    data.frame()

```

We see that there are more donors, and more higher educated, lower age adults in the owns_ethereum = TRUE group

---

## Statistical significance testing

Let's test our hypothesis by applying a t test to see difference between ages of ethereum owners and non owners

```{r}
t.test(age ~ owns_ethereum, data = data)
```

as the p < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. The mean ages are significantly different between ethereum owners and non owners.

---

## Chi-square test of independence

Let us test the relationship between marital_status and ownership

```{r}
chisq.test(table(data$owns_ethereum, data$marital_status))
```

X squared value is high and as the p < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant difference between expected and observed data showing a relationship between these variables.

---

## Your Turn

Is there a statistically significant difference between education levels of ethereum owners and non owners?

Use an appropriate visualization to showcase this difference.

---

## Answer

```{r}
t.test(education_num ~ owns_ethereum, data = data)
```

We see that there is a significant difference (p<0.05) between the age, and education of ethereum owners vs non owners

---

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = owns_ethereum, y = education_num)) +
  geom_boxplot()

```

---

## Multivariate Visualizations - Pair plots

One way to look at the interactions between multiple variables at the same time, is to use pair plots. When we specify a color variable, the correlation for each level is shown.

We load the GGally package, installed using `install.packages("GGally")`, to create pair plots of all the numeric variables

```{r, eval=FALSE, fig.height=7}
library(GGally)
# numerical vars
data %>%
    select(owns_ethereum, age, education_num, capital_gain, capital_loss, hours_per_week) %>%
    ggpairs(columns = 2:6, aes(color = owns_ethereum, alpha = 0.5))
```

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=7}
library(GGally)
data %>%
    select(owns_ethereum, age, education_num, capital_gain, capital_loss, hours_per_week) %>%
    ggpairs(columns = 2:6, aes(color = owns_ethereum, alpha = 0.5))
```

---

Finally we can take a look at all the categorical variables using faceting. The proportions are visualized to understand which variables contribute more to each group

```{r cat, eval=FALSE, fig.show='hold'}
data %>%
    select(
        workclass, marital_status, occupation,
        relationship, race, sex, donated, owns_ethereum
    ) %>%
    pivot_longer(workclass:donated) %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = value, fill = owns_ethereum)) +
    geom_bar(position = "fill", na.rm = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(vars(name), scales = "free") +
    labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = NULL)

```

---

```{r eval= TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6}
data %>%
    select(
        workclass, marital_status, occupation,
        relationship, race, sex, donated, owns_ethereum
    ) %>%
    pivot_longer(workclass:sex) %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = value, fill = owns_ethereum)) +
    geom_bar(position = "fill", na.rm = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(vars(name), scales = "free") +
    labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = NULL)

```
